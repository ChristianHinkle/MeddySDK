# MeddySDK

A superproject providing all the libraries Meddy has to offer. Each one is individually usable, although some may depend on others.

## Project Structure

MeddySDK
- [MeddySDKCLI](https://github.com/ChristianHinko/MeddySDKCLI) (executable)
- [MeddySDK_Meddyproject](https://github.com/ChristianHinko/MeddySDK_Meddyproject) (library)
- [MeddySDK_Meddydata](https://github.com/ChristianHinko/MeddySDK_Meddydata) (library)
- [MeddySDK_DAM](https://github.com/ChristianHinko/MeddySDK_DAM) (library)

These projects are built together using `FetchContent` in CMake. This means they configure together (all from the same invocation of CMake), which makes debugging and development easier with the subprojects.

There is also a "superbuild" version of this project structure which uses `ExternalProject` in CMake to configure each project in isolation, before they get built together. See: [MeddySDKSuperbuild](https://github.com/ChristianHinko/MeddySDKSuperbuild).

## Build System âŒ¨

Built with CMake - cross-platform, standardized, and IDE-friendly.

We provide CMake presets, which handle feeding arguments to CMake for you.

### IDE Support

Most IDEs provide built-in CMake integration.

#### VS Code

Has the "CMake Tools" and "C/C++" extensions, both developed by Microsoft.

#### Visual Studio

Has very nice integration, but they seem behind when it comes to supporting the latest CMake features. I've had experiences where I have to switch to VS Code because of this.

## Build Instructions ðŸ”¨

This project is fully isolated from its dependencies, and therefore must be tied together by a superproject. See [MeddySDKStandalone](https://github.com/ChristianHinko/MeddySDKStandalone) for a complete build setup.

### 1. Invoke CMake on the Project (the Configure Step)

Command line: `cmake --preset="windows-x64-debug"`.

IDE: Choose the `windows-x64-debug` configure preset, and "configure" the CMake project.

### 2. Invoke a Build Command

Command line: `cmake --build --preset="windows-x64-debug"`.

IDE: Choose the `windows-x64-debug` build preset, and "build" it.

## Package Instructions ðŸ“¦

Here's how to package the build into a distributable product.

### 1. Build the Project

See "Build Instructions" above.

### 2. Invoke CPack

Command line: `cpack --preset="meddysdkcli-windows-x64-debug-nsis"`.

IDE: Choose the `meddysdkcli-windows-x64-debug-nsis` package preset, and "package" it.

## Test Instructions ðŸ§ª

Here's how to run automated tests, to verify that our code behaves as intended.

### 1. Build the Project

See "Build Instructions" above.

### 2. Invoke CTest

Command line: `ctest --preset="meddysdk-windows-x64-debug"`.

IDE: Choose the `meddysdk-windows-x64-debug` test preset, and "run tests".
